We were gonna make use of the Github Api to make endpoint calls that generated an issue. The issue would be updated with the highest score ever(in the song playing game) but couldn't finish due to time constraints.

## Inspiration
We know that instruments are expensive and not portable, so we wanted to create a website to allow everyone to experience the fun of playing music! 
## What it does
The website uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to detect your arm movements, and plays the corresponding sound when you hit each note. You can try out different instruments and play different songs.
## How we built it
Using react, node-js, html, css
## Challenges we ran into
The ui was the main one as the camera window kept resizing itself.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Implementing the artificial intelligence!
## What we learned
Tons about ai, ml, web dev.
## What's next for Hype
We will add more instruments and songs. We will add a global scoreboard for each song so that users can compete. We will also implement a collaboration mode so that 2 users can share a keyboard and play a song simultaneously.
